## Project Philosophy

FlowMark is built on the belief that the future of software engineering lies in 
effective human-AI collaboration. Traditional checklists are static and linear, 
but modern engineering workflows are dynamic and context-dependent.

FlowMark bridges this gap by providing:

1. **Completeness**: Ensuring all necessary steps are considered and tracked
2. **Conditional Flow**: Supporting branching logic based on context and conditions
3. **Token-Aware Execution**: Optimizing for AI consumption and generation efficiency

The framework aims to make engineering processes more systematic, reproducible, 
and accessible to both human engineers and AI assistants working together.
