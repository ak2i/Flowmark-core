# FlowMark v0.1.1 Release Notes

Date: 2026-02-09

## Summary

FlowMark v0.1.1 clarifies Coverage Contract authoring while keeping validation behavior unchanged. Contract is recorded in the header for review and future extensibility, but is not enforced by v0.1.x validators.

## Highlights

- Optional Coverage Contract in header (`contract`)
- Validator explicitly ignores Contract semantics
- Parser should preserve Contract metadata for forward compatibility

## Contract (Authoring)

Contract declares expectations such as enumeration target, required groups, and minimum counts. It is intended for human/AI review, not for validation in v0.1.x.

## Compatibility

- v0.1.0 documents remain valid
- v0.1.1 documents are valid as long as unknown header keys are ignored
