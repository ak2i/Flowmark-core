# FlowMark v0.1.6 Release Notes

Release date: 2026-02-10

## Summary

FlowMark v0.1.6 formalizes `group`, adds a normalization params prompt (`flowmark params normalize`), and updates validator behavior to accept `requirement` as an alias for `description` with warnings.

## Changes

- `group` is now a supported item key (no unknown-key warning).
- Item `requirement` is accepted as an alias for `description` (warns with `W_ALIAS_KEY`).
- New CLI subcommand: `flowmark params normalize --lang en --format md`.
- Item status now includes `doing`.
- Unknown keys with `x_*` or `x-...` prefixes are treated as extensions (no warning).

## Backward Compatibility

- v0.1.5 documents remain valid.
- Documents using `requirement` now validate (with warnings).
